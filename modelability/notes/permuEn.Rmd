permuEn

-problem: discard amplitude value
-problem: can't handle equal value

WPE: weight each count by the variance of that subsequence
AAPE: weight each count by an weighted average between the mean and the average difference (between adjacent value) of that subsequence
Modified  (Bian 2012): assign same symbol for equal value. Gave table for maximum entropy for M=3-7
IAUQ: Do uniform quantization first before doing normal entropy calculation.
